# IFN636-A1-MyDocument (PersonalDocumentManager)-Ben-Hsu

A Flask + Jinja2 + MySQL project: a personal document manager UI, using HTML/ CSS and Bootstrap. This build is a scoped-down demo — see **Known Limitations** for exactly which features are real and non-functional.

## Setup

1. **Create the MySQL database**

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE personal_document_manager CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**

   ```bash
   # edit .env with your MySQL credentials
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** (a virtual environment is recommended)

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


4. **Run the server** — from the project root:

   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

   Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 

## Architecture Summary

```

```

## Known Limitations

This build keeps only a few flows fully working end-to-end; everything else is UI-only so the screens can be demoed without a deeper backend.

**Working Functions (version 1.0)**
- Sign up, sign in, sign out
- Core document CRUD functions — save title, category, description, file size as metadata in the database and save file in the project folder, deletes document, update document title, and download document. Only `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.txt` are accepted; other file types are rejected.
- Core Category CRUD functions  — create category, changing a document's category from the dashboard row dropdown (picking one of your existing categories), update category title, and delete a category
- Opening the "My Category" panel to view your categories
- Opening the "upload document" panel to upload your documents
- Toggling a user's Active/Inactive status on the admin dashboard

**Non-functional (present for the UI, no backend effect) (expected to be developed in version 2.0):**
- Search, and the Type / Category / Date / Size / Sort filters on the dashboard, and the search/role/status filters on the admin dashboard — these are decorative; the lists always show everything
- Restore on an older version
- "Continue with Google / Apple" buttons, the admin sidebar's "Settings" link, and "Forgot password?"
- preview document

**Further expectation:**
- Allowing a file to have multiple categories (must redesign the database and both the backend and frontend, but allow more flexible organisation for users)

**Other notes:**
- Storage quotas (20 GB/user, 500 GB total) are hardcoded demo numbers in `config.py`
- Sessions don't expire; replace `SECRET_KEY` with a random value before deploying anywhere real
- Categories are free-text fields on each document, not a separate managed table
- Allowed upload extensions (`ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` in `config.py`) are currently just `pdf`, `docx`, `txt`
